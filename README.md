After reading [this story on medium](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/first-unique-character-in-a-string-javascript-43f277f995b1) about how to find the first unique character in a given string with javascript. I felt motivated to create my own implementation of the article's code.

Feel free to create an Issue or a PR about how could you make this code better.
